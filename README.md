# Anna McIlwraith â€” Author website

This is the public website repo for urban fantasy / paranormal romance author [Anna McIlwraith](http://www.annamcilwraith.com).

It's built using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator, and uses the following open source projects:

[jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
[Lettering JS](http://letteringjs.com/)
[Magnific Popup](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/)

Some of this project could be useful if you're building a similar kind of website. The code for the website itself is clearly open source, and free to use as you wish.
