Anna McIlwraith is the author of [The Wild Rites Saga](/books/the-wild-rites-saga/) and the upcoming paranormal romance series the [Wayward Heart](/books/wayward-heart/). She’s addicted to the mysterious power of using words to walk between worlds, and there’s nowhere she’d rather be than travelling the dusty roads and dark kingdoms of the worlds of her books. Sadly, one can visit those territories but never stay, which is the only reason Anna gets any reading of her own done. 

When not reading or writing, Anna spends the rest of her free time in this dimension arguing with her cats and preparing for the zombie apocalypse. She lives near the sea in Victoria, Australia, where the weather is only slightly less hellish, but the wildlife is a lot less deadly.
