Welcome to the world of the Caller of the Blood &mdash; a world where shapechangers live right alongside us, in modern cities and in ancient sanctuaries unknown to humankind, descendants of a magical union between gods and mortals forged in the mists of time. 

The many races of their kind share an ages-old prophecy that foretells of a human woman born to command the magic of all shapechanging races. Her power is either a weapon of mass destruction or the ultimate pacifier &mdash; depending on who wields it. She is the Caller of the Blood, and whoever controls her holds that power in his grasp. But first they have to find her.

Emma Chase is no stranger to tragedy, or magic &mdash; she lost almost everything in a fire when she was eleven, and her best friend happens to be a were-jaguar. She has no desire to visit the world he ran away from &mdash; a world of violence, wonder, and the constant struggle for power. But the choice is no longer hers when that world catches up to them, and then it’s a race for her freedom and her sanity, as rival kingdoms clash and unlikely friends show up in the strangest of places. 

Emma’s determined to control her own destiny &mdash; but that gets more and more difficult, especially when it becomes apparent that she isn't just the metaphysical equivalent of a weapon of mass destruction &mdash; she’s also a miracle cure for the mysterious wasting illness slowly but surely eradicating shapechanger races the world over. 

Kings and queens, royals and rivalry, gods and monsters &mdash; all of it would be enough to contend with, but Emma’s also managed to attract the attention of something else even more ruthless, bloody and terrifying. Something the shapechangers call soul-eater. 
Enter a world where blood can speak, magic can die and gods walk among us. It’s a world Emma has to survive in now &mdash; but she wants more than survival. She wants to keep her friends safe, stay true to herself, and maybe do some good &mdash; all without getting her heart broken.

But the odds are stacked against her.
