Los Angeles &mdash; a city of glamour and grime, of glittering light and darkest night. And that’s just the human side. When the sun sets on the City of Angels, the real freaks come out to play &mdash; half-breed demons and newly-turned vampires, witches and warlocks and immigrant fae. The folks at Branch Zero try to keep murder and mishap to a minimum, but for a shadow organization that no-one wants to admit exists, budget cuts sure can be a pain in the ass, especially with a spate of serial murders burning up resources.

So when the homeless and the hunted of L.A.’s preternatural population need somewhere to hide, the Wayward Heart Hostel takes them in. The sheets are clean, the rates are cheap, and the owner happens to be a half-seraph with a mean knack for magical wards, hands full of flame, and a lot of very powerful friends. But no matter how powerful you are, right now it’s dangerous to be one of L.A.’s non-human denizens &mdash; for the cult of the Black Dawn are cooking up something unholy, and they’re killing preternaturals in order to do it.

Romance. Violence. Room service.

Welcome to the Wayward Heart.
